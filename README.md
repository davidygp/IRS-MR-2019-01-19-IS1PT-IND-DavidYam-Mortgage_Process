### Note: This Process was created by following the Machine Reasoning Workshops 1-3.

This Process differs from Workshop 3 in that: 
- It has both checkboxes "inlimit Machine Reasoning" & "inlimit Machine Reasoning DT" exposed.

This was done for more ease of understanding from the approver, because each inlimit has slightly different underlying logic.
